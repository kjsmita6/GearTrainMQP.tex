The goal of this project is to convert gear design software made in a previous MQP from the outdated Windows Forms graphics framework to the newer WPF framework, and improve it. Through many user studies, we were able to determine how users responded to the software to see what changes should be made. Users recommended that a 3D representation of the gear train design be added, so that was included in the system. After many iterative refinement steps through the User Interface and program flow, our users generally agree that our new program, titled \emph{GearTrain}, is a significant improvement over the previous system. \emph{GearTrain} teaches Mechanical Engineering students about gear concepts and simplifies the designing of gear trains.
